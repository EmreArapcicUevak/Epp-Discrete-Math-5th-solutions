## About

> ***It soon became clear that the unconscious instincts for logic and language which had enabled me to succeed were not shared by the large majority of my students.*** - Susanna Epp (author of [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC))

Solutions to Susanna Epp's [Discrete Mathematics 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC)

**This is much gentler than [MIT Math for CS](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions), and covers the same material.**
