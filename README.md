## About

> ***It soon became clear that the unconscious instincts for logic and language which had enabled me to succeed were not shared by the large majority of my students.*** - Susanna Epp (author of [Discrete Mathematics with Applications, 5th edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC))

Solutions to Susanna Epp's [Discrete Mathematics 5th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp-ebook/dp/B07M87BWRC)

**This is much gentler than [MIT Math for CS](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions), and covers the same material.**

## Contributing

Only edit the `Epp.tex` source file, I use Github Actions to compile and release the PDF file automatically.

So, you do not have to include your compiled PDF in your pull requests.

### Compiling locally

You don't need to do this for contributing, Github actions will take care of it for you on pull requests.

But if you are compiling locally, you'll need:

- a full [TeXlive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) installation (you do need the *full* thing, I use some rare / obscure packages), and
- since I am using [minted](https://github.com/gpoore/minted) for syntax highlighting some code, you'll have to pass the [`-shell-escape` argument](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/598818/how-can-i-enable-shell-escape#598819) to `latexmk` for the compilation.
