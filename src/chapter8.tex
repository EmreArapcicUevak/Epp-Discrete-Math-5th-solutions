\section{Exercise Set 8.1}

\subsection{Exercise 1}
As in Example 8.1.2, the {\bf congruence modulo 2} relation $E$ is defined from $\Z$ to $\Z$ as follows: For every 
ordered pair \((m, n) \in \Z \times \Z\), $m$ $E$ $n$ \(\iff m - n\) is even.

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is $0$ $E$ $0$? Is $5$ $E$ $2$? Is $(6, 6) \in E$? Is $(21, 7) \in E$?

\begin{proof}
$0$ $E$ $0$ because \(0 - 0 = 0 = 2 \cdot 0\), so \(2 \mid (0 - 0)\). $5$ $\Ccancel{E}$ $2$ because \(5 - 2 = 3\) and 
\(3 \neq 2k\) for any integer $k$, so \(2 \nmid (5 - 2)\). \((6, 6) \in E\) because \(6 - 6 = 0 = 2 \cdot 0\), so \(2 
\mid (6 - 6). (-1, 7) \in E\) because \(-1 - 7 = -8 = 2 \cdot (-4)\), so \(2 \mid (-1 - 7)\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Prove that for any even integer $n$, $n$ $E$ $0$.

\begin{proof}
Assume $n$ is even. By definition of even, $n=2k$ for some integer $k$. Then \(n - 0 = 2k - 0 = 2k\) is also even.
Therefore by definition of $E$, $n$ $E$ 0.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 2}
Prove that for all integers $m$ and $n$, $m - n$ is even if, and only if, both $m$ and $n$ are even or both $m$ and 
$n$ are odd.

\begin{proof}
\(\bm{\implies}\): Assume $m-n$ is even. {\it [We want to prove that both $m$ and $n$ are even or both $m$ and $n$ 
are odd.]} By definition of even, \(m - n = 2k\) for some integer $k$. There are 4 cases:

{\bf Case 1: both $m$ and $n$ are even:} Nothing to prove.

{\bf Case 2: both $m$ and $n$ are odd:} Nothing to prove.

{\bf Case 3: $m$ is even, $n$ is odd:} By definitions of even and odd, \(m=2k, n=2l+1\) for some integers $k,l$. 
So \(m-n = 2k-2l-1 = 2(k-l-1) + 1\) where \(k-l-1\) is an integer. So by definition of odd, \(m-n\) is odd, a 
contradiction. So this case is impossible.

{\bf Case 4: $m$ is odd, $n$ is even:} By definitions of even and odd, \(m=2k+1, n=2l\) for some integers $k,l$. 
So \(m-n = 2k+1-2l = 2(k-l) + 1\) where \(k-l\) is an integer. So by definition of odd, \(m-n\) is odd, a 
contradiction. So this case is impossible.

\(\bm{\impliedby}\): Assume both $m$ and $n$ are even or both $m$ and $n$ are odd. {\it [We want to prove that $m-n$ 
is even.]} There are 2 cases:

{\bf Case 1: both $m$ and $n$ are even:} By definition of even, \(m = 2k, n = 2l\) for some integers $k,l$. Then 
\(m-n = 2k-2l = 2(k-l)\) where $k-l$ is an integer. So by definition, $m-n$ is even.

{\bf Case 2: both $m$ and $n$ are odd:} By definition of even, \(m = 2k+1, n = 2l+1\) for some integers $k,l$. Then 
\(m-n = 2k+1-2l-1 = 2(k-l)\) where $k-l$ is an integer. So by definition, $m-n$ is even.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 3}
The congruence modulo 3 relation, $T$, is defined from $\Z$ to $\Z$ as follows: For all integers $m$ and $n$, $m$ $T$ 
$n$ \(\iff 3 \mid (m - n)\).

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is $10$ $T$ $1$? Is $1$ $T$ $10$? Is \((2, 2) \in T\)? Is \((8, 1) \in T\)?

\begin{proof}
10 $T$ 1 because \(10 - 1 = 9 = 3 \cdot 3\), and so \(3 \mid (10 - 1)\).

1 $T$ 10 because \(1 - 10 = -9 = 3 \cdot (-3)\), and so \(3 \mid (1 - 10)\).

2 $T$ 2 because \(2 - 2 = 0 = 3 \cdot 0\), and so \(3 \mid (2 - 2)\).

8 $\Ccancel{T}$ 1 because \(8 - 1 = 7 \neq 3k\), for any integer $k$. So \(3 \nmid (8 - 1)\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
List five integers $n$ such that $n$ $T$ $0$.

\begin{proof}
One possible answer: 3, 6, 9, $-3$, $-6$
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
List five integers $n$ such that $n$ $T$ 1.

\begin{proof}
One possible answer: 4, 7, 10, $-2$, $-5$
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(d)}
List five integers $n$ such that $n$ $T$ $2$.

\begin{proof}
One possible answer: 5, 8, 11, $-1$, $-4$
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(e)}
Make and prove a conjecture about which integers are related by $T$ to $0$, which integers are related by $T$ to 
1, and which integers are related by $T$ to 2.

All integers of the form \(3k + 1\), for some integer $k$, are related by $T$ to $1$.

\begin{proof}
All integers of the form \(3k\), for some integer $k$, are related by $T$ to 0.

All integers of the form \(3k+1\), for some integer $k$, are related by $T$ to 1.

All integers of the form \(3k+2\), for some integer $k$, are related by $T$ to 2.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 4}
Define a relation $P$ on $\Z$ as follows: For every ordered pair \((m, n) \in \Z \times \Z\), $m$ $P$ $n$ \(\iff\) $m$ 
and $n$ have a common prime factor.

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is 15 $P$ 25?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because 15 and 25 are both divisible by 5, which is prime.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is 22 $P$ 27?

\begin{proof}
No, because 22 and 27 have no common prime factor.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is 0 $P$ 5?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because 0 and 5 are both divisible by 5, which is prime.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(d)}
Is 8 $P$ 8?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because 8 and 8 are both divisible by 2, which is prime.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 5}
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\). Recall that \(\ps(X)\) is the power set of $X$. Define a relation {\bf S} on \(\ps(X)\) 
as follows: For all sets $A$ and $B$ in \(\ps(X)\), $A$ {\bf S} $B$ $\iff$ $A$ has the same number of elements as $B$.

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is \(\{a, b\}\) {\bf S} \(\{b, c\}\)?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because both \(\{a, b\}\) and \(\{b, c\}\) have two elements.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is \(\{a\}\) {\bf S} \(\{a,b\}\)?

\begin{proof}
No, one has 1 element, the other has 2 elements.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is \(\{c\}\) {\bf S} \(\{b\}\)?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because both \(\{c\}\) and \(\{b\}\) have one element.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 6}
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\). Define a relation {\bf J} on \(\ps(X)\) as follows: For all sets $A$ and $B$ in $\ps(X)$,
$A$ {\bf J} $B$ $\iff$ \(A \cap B \neq \es\).

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is $\{a\}$ {\bf J} $\{c\}$?

\begin{proof}
No, because \(\{a\} \cap \{c\} = \es\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is $\{a, b\}$ {\bf J} $\{b, c\}$?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because \(\{a,b\} \cap \{b,c\} = \{b\} \neq \es\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is $\{a, b\}$ {\bf J} $\{a, b, c\}$?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because \(\{a,b\} \cap \{a,b,c\} = \{a,b\} \neq \es\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 7}
Define a relation $R$ on $\Z$ as follows: For all integers $m$ and $n$, $m$ $R$ $n$ $\iff$ \(5 \mid (m^2 - n^2)\).

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is 1 $R$ $(-9)$?

\begin{proof}
Yes. 1 $R$ \((-9) \iff 5 \mid (1^2 - (-9)^2)\). But \(1^2 - (-9)^2 = 1 - 81 = -80\), and \(5 \mid (-80)\) because 
\(-80 = 5 \cdot (-16)\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is 2 $R$ 13?

\begin{proof}
Yes, \(2^2 - (13)^2 = 4 - 169 = -165 = 5 \cdot (-33)\). So \(5 \mid 2^2 - (13)^2\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is 2 $R$ $(-8)$?

\begin{proof}
Yes, \(2^2 - (-8)^2 = 4 - 64 = -60 = 5 \cdot (-12)\). So \(5 \mid 2^2 - (-8)^2\).
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(d)}
Is $(-8)$ $R$ 2?

\begin{proof}
Yes, \((-8)^2 - 2^2 = 64 - 4 = 60 = 5 \cdot 12\). So \(5 \mid (-8)^2 - 2^2\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 8}
Let $A$ be the set of all strings of $a$’s and $b$’s of length 4. Define a relation $R$ on $A$ as follows: For 
every \(s, t \in A\), $s$ $R$ $t$ $\iff$ $s$ has the same first two characters as $t$.

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is $abaa$ $R$ $abba$?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because both $abaa$ and $abba$ have the same first two characters $ab$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is $aabb$ $R$ $bbaa$?

\begin{proof}
No, because the first two characters of $aabb$ are different from the first two characters of $bbaa$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is $aaaa$ $R$ $aaab$?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because both $aaaa$ and $aaab$ have the same first two characters $aa$.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(d)}
Is $baaa$ $R$ $abaa$?

\begin{proof}
No, because the first two characters of $baaa$ are different from the first two characters of $abaa$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 9}
Let $A$ be the set of all strings of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s of length 4. Define a relation $R$ on $A$ as follows: For 
every \(s, t \in A\), $s$ $R$ $t$ $\iff$ the sum of the characters in $s$ equals the sum of the characters in $t$.

\subsubsection{(a)}
Is 0121 $R$ 2200?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because the sum of the characters in 0121 is 4 and the sum of the characters in 2200 is also 4.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Is 1011 $R$ 2101?

\begin{proof}
No, because the sum of the characters in 1011 is 3, whereas the sum of the characters in 2101 is 4.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(c)}
Is 2212 $R$ 2121?

\begin{proof}
No, because the sum of the characters in 2212 is 7, whereas the sum of the characters in 2121 is 6.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(d)}
Is 1220 $R$ 2111?

\begin{proof}
Yes, because the sum of the characters in 1220 is 5 and the sum of the characters in 2111 is also 5.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 10}
Let \(A = \{3, 4, 5\}\) and \(B = \{4, 5, 6\}\) and let $R$ be the “less than” relation. That is, for every ordered 
pair \((x, y) \in A \times B, x \, R \, y \iff x < y\). State explicitly which ordered pairs are in $R$ and $R^{-1}$.

\begin{proof}
\(R = \{(3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 6)\}\)

\(R^{-1} = \{(4, 3), (5, 3), (6, 3), (5, 4), (6, 4), (6, 5)\}\)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 11}
Let \(A = \{3, 4, 5\}\) and \(B = \{4, 5, 6\}\) and let $S$ be the “divides” relation. That is, for every ordered pair 
\((x, y) \in A \times B, x \, S \, y \iff x \mid y\). State explicitly which ordered pairs are in $S$ and $S^{-1}$.

\begin{proof}
\(S = \{(3, 6), (4, 4), (5, 5)\}, S^{-1} = \{(6, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)\}\)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 12}

\subsubsection{(a)}
Suppose a function \(F: X \to Y\) is one-to-one but not onto. Is \(F^{-1}\) (the inverse relation for $F$) a 
function? Explain your answer.

\begin{proof}
No. If \(F: X \to Y\) is not onto, then $F$ fails to be defined on all of $Y$. In other words, there is an element 
$y$ in $Y$ such that \((y, x) \notin F^{-1}\) for any \(x \in X\). Consequently, \(F^{-1}\) does not satisfy property 
(1) of the definition of function.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{(b)}
Suppose a function \(F: X \to Y\) is onto but not one-to-one. Is \(F^{-1}\) (the inverse relation for $F$) a 
function? Explain your answer.

\begin{proof}
No. If \(F: X \to Y\) is not one-to-one, then $F$ for some $y$ in $Y$, there will be multiple potential values for 
\(F^{-1}(y)\). In other words, there is an element $y$ in $Y$ and elements \(x_1, x_2 \in X\) such that \((y, x_1) 
\in F^{-1}\) and \((y, x_2) \in F^{-1}\). Consequently, \(F^{-1}\) does not satisfy property (2) of the definition 
of function.
\end{proof}

2 \mid (x - y)\).

\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 17}
Let \(A = \{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\) and define a relation $T$ on $A$ as follows: For every \(x, y \in A, x \, T \, y 
\iff 3 \mid (x - y)\).

\begin{proof}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../images/8.1.17.png}
\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 18}
Let \(A = \{0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\) and define a relation $V$ on $A$ as follows: For every \(x, y \in A, x \, V \, y \iff 
5 \mid (x^2 - y^2)\).

\begin{proof}
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{../images/8.1.18.png}
\end{figure}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 19}
Let \(A = \{2, 4\}\) and \(B = \{6, 8, 10\}\) and define relations $R$ and $S$ from $A$ to $B$ as follows: For every 
\((x, y) \in A \times B, x \, R \, y \iff x \mid y\) and \( x \, S \, y \iff y - 4 = x\). State explicitly which 
ordered pairs are in \(A \times B, R, S, R \cup S\), and \(R \cap S\).

\begin{proof}
\(A \times B = \{(2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 10), (4, 6), (4, 8), (4, 10)\}\)

\(R = \{(2, 6), (2, 8), (2, 10), (4, 8)\}\), \(S = \{(2, 6), (4, 8)\}\), \(R \cup S = R, R \cap S = S\)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 20}
Let \(A = \{-1, 1, 2, 4\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2\}\) and define relations $R$ and $S$ from $A$ to $B$ as follows: For every 
\((x, y) \in A \times B, x \, R \, y \iff |x| \mid |y|\) and \(x \, S \, y \iff x - y\) is even. State explicitly 
which ordered pairs are in \(A \times B, R, S, R \cup S\), and \(R \cap S\).

\begin{proof}
\(A \times B = \{(-1, 1), (-1, 2), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (4, 1), (4, 2)\}\)

\(R = \{(-1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)\}\), \(S = \{(-1, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 2)\}\), \(R \cup S = S, R \cap S = R\)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 21}
Define relations $R$ and $S$ on $R$ as follows: \(R = \{(x, y) \in \R \times \R \, | \, x < y\}\) and 

\(S = \{(x, y) \in \R \times \R \, | \, x = y\}\). That is, $R$ is the “less than” relation and $S$ is the “equals” 
relation on $\R$. Graph \(R, S, R \cup S\), and \(R \cap S\) in the Cartesian plane.

\begin{proof}
The graph of the intersection of $R$ and $S$ is obtained by finding the set of all points common to both graphs. But 
there are no points for which both \(x < y\) and \(x = y\). Hence \(R \cap S = \es\) and the graph consists of no 
points at all.

\subsection{Exercise 9}
$R$ is the “greater than or equal to” relation on the set of real numbers: For every \(x, y \in \R, x \, R \, y \iff 
x \geq y\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} \(R\) is reflexive iff for every real number \(x, x \, R \, x\). By definition of 
\(R\), this means that for every real number \(x, x \geq x\). In other words, for every real number \(x, x > x\) or 
\(x = x\), which is true.

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is not symmetric:} \(R\) is symmetric iff for all real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x \, R \, y\) 
then \(y \, R \, x\). By definition of \(R\), this means that for all real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), if \(x \geq y\) 
then \(y \geq x\). The following counterexample shows that this is false. \(x = 1\) and \(y = 0\). Then \(x \geq y\), 
but \(y \ngeq x\) because \(1 \geq 0\) and \(0 \ngeq 1\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is transitive:} \(R\) is transitive iff for all real numbers \(x, y\), and \(z\), if \(x \, R \, y\) 
and \(y \, R \, z\) then \(x \, R \, z\). By definition of \(R\), this means that for all real numbers \(x, y\), and 
\(z\), if \(x \geq y\) and \(y \geq z\) then \(x \geq z\). This is true by definition of \(\geq\) and the transitive 
property of order for the real numbers. (See Appendix A, T18.)
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 10}
$C$ is the circle relation on the set of real numbers: For every \(x, y \in \R, x \, C \, y \iff x^2 + y^2 = 1\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{C}\) is not reflexive:} Let \(x = 0\). Then \(0^2 + 0^2 = 0 \neq 1\), therefore \(0 \Ccancel{C} 0\).

{\bf \(\bm{C}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(x \, C \, y\). Then \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\). So \(y^2 + x^2 = 1\). So \(y\, C \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{C}\) is not transitive:} Let \(x = 1, y = 0, z = 1\). Then \(x \, C \, y\) because \(1^2 + 0^2 = 1\), and
\(y \, C \, z\) because \(0^2 + 1^2 = 1\). However \(x \, \Ccancel{C} \, z\) because \(1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \neq 1\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 11}
$D$ is the relation defined on $\R$ as follows: For every \(x, y \in \R, x \, D \, y \iff xy \geq 0\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is reflexive:} For all real numbers \(x, x \cdot x = x^2 \geq 0\) so \(x \, D \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(x \, D \, y\). Then \(xy \geq 0\). So \(yx \geq 0\). So \(y \, D \, x\). 

{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is not transitive:} Let \(x = 1, y = 0, z = -1\). Then \(xy = 0 \geq 0\) so \(x \, D \, y\), and
\(yz = 0 \geq 0\) so \(y \, D \, z\), but \(xz = -1 \ngeq 0\) so \(x \Ccancel{D} z\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 12}
$E$ is the congruence modulo 4 relation on $\Z$: For every \(m, n \in \Z, m \, E \, n \iff 4 \mid (m - n)\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{E}\) is reflexive:} For all \(m \in \Z, (m-m) = 0 = 4 \cdot 0\) so \(4 \mid (m-m)\) thus \(m\,E\,m\).

{\bf \(\bm{E}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(m \, E \, n\). Then \(4\mid(m-n)\). So \(m-n = 4\cdot k\) for some integer $k$.
So \(n-m = 4 \cdot (-k)\) where $-k$ is an integer. So \(4 \mid (n-m)\) and \(n \, E \, m\).

{\bf \(\bm{E}\) is transitive:} Assume \(m \, E \, n\) and \(n \, E \, o\). Then \(4 \mid (m-n)\) and \(4\mid (n-o)\).
So \(m-n = 4k\) and \(n-o = 4l\) for some integers \(k,l\). So \(m-o = (m-n) + (n-o) = 4k+4l = 4(k+l)\) where \(k+l\) 
is an integer. Thus \(4 \mid (m-o)\) and \(m \,E\,o\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 13}
$F$ is the congruence modulo 5 relation on $\Z$: For every \(m, n \in \Z, m \, F \, n \iff 5 \mid (m - n)\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{F}\) is reflexive:} The proof is the same as in exercise 12.

{\bf \(\bm{F}\) is symmetric:} The proof is the same as in exercise 12.

{\bf \(\bm{F}\) is transitive:} The proof is the same as in exercise 12.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 14}
$O$ is the relation defined on $\Z$ as follows: For every \(m, n \in \Z, m \, O \, n \iff m - n\) is odd.

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{O}\) is not reflexive:} \(0 - 0 = 0\) is even, therefore \(0 \Ccancel{O} 0\).

{\bf \(\bm{O}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(m \, O \, n\). So \(m-n\) is odd. So \(m-n = 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). So
\(n-m = -2k-1 = 2(-k-1)+1\) where \(-k-1\) is an integer. So \(n-m\) is odd and \(n \, O \, m\).

{\bf \(\bm{O}\) is not transitive:} \(2 - 1 = 1\) is odd so \(2 \, O \, 1\), and \(1 - 0 = 1\) is odd so \(1 \,O\,0\),
but \(2-0 = 2\) is even so \(2 \Ccancel{O} 0\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 15}
$D$ is the “divides” relation on \(Z^+\): For all positive integers $m$ and \(n, m \, D \, n \iff m \mid n\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is reflexive:} For all \(m \in \Z^+\) \(m = m \cdot 1\) therefore \(m \mid m\), so \(m \, D \, m\).

{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is not symmetric:} \(3 \, D \, 6\) because \(3 \mid 6\) because \(6 = 3 \cdot 2\), but \(6 \Ccancel{D}
3\) because \(6 \nmid 3\) since \(3 / 6 = 1/2\) is not an integer.

{\bf \(\bm{D}\) is transitive:} Assume \(m \, D \, n\) and \(n \, D \, o\). Then \(m \mid n\) and \(n \mid o\). So
\(n = mk\) and \(o = nl\) for some integers \(k, l\). So \(o = nl = (mk)l = m(kl)\) where \(kl\) is an integer. So
\(m \mid o\) and \(m \, D \, o\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 16}
$A$ is the “absolute value” relation on $\R$: For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, \(x \, A \, y \iff |x| = |y|\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{A}\) is reflexive:} For all real numbers \(x, |x| = |x|\) so \(x \, A \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{A}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(x \, A \, y\) so \(|x| = |y|\). Then \(|y| = |x|\) so \(y \, A \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{A}\) is transitive:} Assume \(x \, A \, y\) and \(y \, A \, z\), so \(|x| = |y|\) and \(|y| = |z|\). Then
\(|x| = |y| = |z|\) so \(x \, A \, z\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 17}
Recall that a prime number is an integer that is greater than 1 and has no positive integer divisors other than 1 
and itself. (In particular, 1 is not prime.) A relation $P$ is defined on $\Z$ as follows: For every \(m, n \in \Z, m 
\, P \, n \iff \exists\) a prime number $p$ such that \(p \mid m\) and \(p \mid n\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{P}\) is not reflexive:} There is no prime number $p$ such that \(p \mid 1\) and \(p \mid 1\). Thus
\(1 \Ccancel{P} 1\).

{\bf \(\bm{P}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(m \, P \, n\). So there is a prime number $p$ such that \(p \mid m\) and 
\(p \mid n\). So \(p \mid n\) and \(p \mid m\), and thus \(n \, P \, m\).

{\bf \(\bm{P}\) is not transitive:} Let \(m = 6, n = 15, o = 35\). Then the prime $p = 3$ divides both $m$ and $n$, so
\(m \, P \, n\), and the prime $q = 5$ divides both $n$ and $o$, so \(n \, P \, o\), but there is no prime that divides
both $m = 2 \cdot 3$ and $o = 5 \cdot 7$, so \(m \Ccancel{P} o\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 18}
Define a relation $Q$ on $\R$ as follows: For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, \(x \, Q \, y \iff x - y\) is 
rational.

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{Q}\) is reflexive:} For all reals \(x \in \R, x-x = 0\) and 0 is rational, so \(x \, Q \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{Q}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(x \, Q \, y\). Then \(x - y\) is rational. Then \(y-x = -(x-y)\) is rational 
(being the negative of a rational). So \(y \, Q \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{Q}\) is transitive:} Assume \(x \, Q \, y\) and \(y \, Q \, z\). Then \(x - y\) and \(y - z\) are rational.
So \(x - z = (x-y) + (y-z)\) is also rational (being the sum of two rationals). Thus \(x \, Q \, z\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 19}
Define a relation $I$ on $\R$ as follows: For all real numbers $x$ and $y$, \(x \, I \, y \iff x - y\) is 
irrational.

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{I}\) is not reflexive:} For all reals \(x \in \R, x - x = 0\) and 0 is not irrational, 
so \(x \Ccancel{I} x\).

{\bf \(\bm{I}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(x \, I \, y\). Then \(x - y\) is irrational. So \(y-x = -(x-y)\) is irrational 
(being the negative of an irrational). So \(y \, I \, x\).

{\bf \(\bm{I}\) is not transitive:} Let \(x = \sqrt{2}, y = 0, z = \sqrt{2}\). Then \(x \, I \, y\) because \(x - y = 
\sqrt{2}\) is irrational. Also \(y \, I \, z\) because \(y - z = -\sqrt{2}\) is irrational. But \(x - z = 0\) is not
irrational, thus \(x \Ccancel{I} z\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 20}
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\) and \(\ps(X)\) be the power set of $X$ (the set of all subsets of $X$). A relation {\bf E} is 
defined on \(\ps(X)\) as follows: For every \(A, B \in \ps(X), A \,\textbf{E}\, B \iff \) the number of elements 
in $A$ equals the number of elements in $B$.

\begin{proof}
{\bf E is reflexive:} For every \(A \in \ps(X)\), the number of elements in $A$ equals the number of elements in 
$A$. So \(A \,\textbf{E}\, A\).

{\bf E is symmetric:} Assume \(A \,\textbf{E}\, B\). Then the number of elements in $A$ equals the number of elements 
in $B$. So, the number of elements in $B$ equals the number of elements in $A$. So \(B \,\textbf{E}\, A\).

{\bf E is transitive:} Assume \(A \,\textbf{E}\, B\) and \(B \,\textbf{E}\, C\). Then the number of elements in $A$ 
equals the number of elements in $B$, and the number of elements in $B$ equals the number of elements in $C$. So 
the number of elements in $A$ equals the number of elements 
in $C$. So \(A \,\textbf{E}\, C\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 21}
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\) and \(\ps(X)\) be the power set of $X$. A relation {\bf L} is defined on \(\ps(X)\) as 
follows: For every \(A, B \in \ps(X), A \,\textbf{L}\, B \iff \) the number of elements in $A$ is less than the 
number of elements in $B$.

\begin{proof}
{\bf L is not reflexive:} For all \(A \in \ps(X)\), the number of elements in $A$ is not less than the number of 
elements in $A$. So \(A \,\Ccancel{\textbf{L}}\, A\).

{\bf L is not symmetric:} Let \(A = \es, B = \{a\}\). Then the number of elements in $A$ (which is 0) is less than the 
number of elements in $B$ (which is 1). So \(A \,\textbf{L}\, B\). But the number of elements in $B$ (which is 1) is 
not less than the number of elements in $A$ (which is 0). So \(B\,\Ccancel{\textbf{L}}\, A\).

{\bf L is transitive:} Assume \(A \, \textbf{L} \, B\) and \(B \, \textbf{L} \, C\). Then the number of elements in 
$A$ is less than the number of elements in $B$, and the number of elements in $B$ is less than the number of 
elements in $C$. Then the number of elements in $A$ is less than the number of elements in $C$. So \(A \, \textbf{L} \, C\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 22}
Let \(X = \{a, b, c\}\) and \(\ps(X)\) be the power set of $X$. A relation {\bf N} is defined on \(\ps(X)\) as 
follows: For every \(A, B \in \ps(X), A \textbf{N} B \iff \) the number of elements in $A$ is not equal to the number 
of elements in $B$.

\begin{proof}
{\bf N is not reflexive:} Let \(A = \{a\}\) which has 1 element. Then the number of elements in $A$ is equal to the number of elements in $A$. So \(A \,\Ccancel{\textbf{N}}\, A\).

{\bf N is symmetric:} Assume \(A \,\textbf{N}\, B\). Then the number of elements in $A$ is not equal to the number 
of elements in $B$. So the number of elements in $B$ is not equal to the number of elements in $A$, and 
\(B \,\textbf{N}\, A\).

{\bf N is not transitive:} Let \(A = \{a\}, B = \es, C = \{c\}\). Then \(A \,\textbf{N}\, B\) because $A$ has 1 
element and $B$ has 0 elements, and $0 \neq 1$. Similarly \(B \,\textbf{N}\, C\). But \(A \,\Ccancel{\textbf{N}}\, C\)
because both $A$ and $C$ have 1 element, and 1 = 1.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 23}
Let $X$ be a nonempty set and \(\ps(X)\) the power set of $X$. Define the “subset” relation {\bf S} on \(\ps(X)\) as 
follows: For every \(A, B \in \ps(X), A \,\textbf{S}\, B \iff A \subseteq B\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf S is reflexive:} For all \(A \in \ps(X), A \subseteq A\) therefore \(A \,\textbf{S}\, A\).

{\bf S is not symmetric:} Let \(A = \{a\}, B = \{a, b\}\). Then \(A \subseteq B\), so \(A \,\textbf{S}\, B\). But 
\(B \nsubseteq A\) therefore \(B \,\Ccancel{\textbf{S}}\, A\).

{\bf S is transitive:} Assume \(A \,\textbf{S}\, B\) and \(B \,\textbf{S}\, C\). So \(A \subseteq B\) and 
\(B \subseteq C\). Then by transitivity of subsets, \(A \subseteq C\), and \(A \,\textbf{S}\, C\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 24}
Let \(X\) be a nonempty set and \(\ps(X)\) the power set of $X$. Define the “not equal to” relation {\bf U} on 
\(\ps(X)\) as follows: For every \(A, B \in \ps(X), A \textbf{U} B \iff A \neq B\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf U is not reflexive:} For every \(A \in \ps(X), A = A\) therefore \(A \, \Ccancel{\textbf{U}} \, A\).

{\bf U is symmetric:} Assume \(A \, \textbf{U} \, B\). Then \(A \neq B\). So \(B \neq A\), and \(B \,\textbf{U} \, A\).

{\bf U is not transitive:} Let \(X = \{x\}, A = \{x\}, B = \es, C = \{x\}\). Then \(A \, \textbf{U} \, B\) because 
\(A \neq B\), and \(B\,\textbf{U}\,C\) because \(B \neq C\), but \(A = C\) so \(A \, \Ccancel{\textbf{U}} \, C\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 25}
Let $A$ be the set of all strings of $a$’s and $b$’s of length 4. Define a relation \(R\) on \(A\) as follows: For 
every \(s, t \in A, s \, R \, t \iff s\) has the same first two characters as \(t\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} For every string \(s \in A\), $s$ has the same first two characters as $s$. Thus
\(s \, R \, s\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(s \, R \, t\). Then $s$ has the same first two characters as $t$. Then $t$ has
the same first two characters as $s$, so \(t \, R \, s\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is transitive:} Assume \(s \, R \, t\) and \(t \, R \, r\). Then $s$ has the same first two characters 
as $t$, and $t$ has the same first two characters as $r$. So $s$ has the same first two characters as $r$, and 
\(s \, R \, r\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 26}
Let \(A\) be the set of all strings of 0’s, 1’s, and 2’s that have length 4 and for which the sum of the characters 
in the string is less than or equal to 2. Define a relation \(R\) on \(A\) as follows: For every \(s, t \in A, s \, R 
\, t \iff\) the sum of the characters of \(s\) equals the sum of the characters of \(t\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} For every \(s, \in A\), the sum of the characters of \(s\) equals the sum of the 
characters of \(s\). So \(s \, R \, s\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(s \, R \, t\). Then the sum of the characters of \(s\) equals the sum of the 
characters of \(t\). So the sum of the characters of \(t\) equals the sum of the characters of \(s\), and \(s\,R\,t\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is transitive:} Assume \(s \, R \, t\) and \(t \, R \, r\). Then the sum of the characters of \(s\) 
equals the sum of the characters of \(t\), and the sum of the characters of \(t\) equals the sum of the characters of 
\(r\). So the sum of the characters of \(s\) equals the sum of the characters of \(r\), and \(s\,R\,r\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 27}
Let \(A\) be the set of all English statements. A relation {\bf I} is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \(p, q 
\in A, p \,\textbf{I}\, q \iff p \implies q\) is true.

\begin{proof}
{\bf I is reflexive:} For every \(p \in A, p \implies p\) is true, therefore \(p \, \textbf{I} \, p\).

{\bf I is not symmetric:} Let $p$ be ``$1 is greater than 2$'' and let $q$ be ``2 is greater than 1''. So $p$ is 
false and $q$ is true. Therefore \(p \implies q\) is true and \(q \implies p\) is false. So \(p \, \textbf{I} \, q\)
but \(q \, \Ccancel{\textbf{I}} \, p\).

{\bf I is transitive:} Assume \(p \, \textbf{I} \, q\) and \(q \, \textbf{I} \, r\). So \(p \implies q\) is true and
\(q \implies r\) is true. By transitivity of implication, \(p \implies r\) is true, and \(p \, \textbf{I} \, r\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 28}
Let \(A = \R \times \R\). A relation {\bf F} is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)
\) in $A$, \((x_1, y_1) \textbf{F} (x_2, y_2) \iff x_1 = x_2\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf F is reflexive:} For every \((x, y) \in A, x = x\), therefore \((x, y) \textbf{F} (x, y)\).

{\bf F is symmetric:} Assume \((x_1, y_1) \textbf{F} (x_2, y_2)\). Then \(x_1 = x_2\). Then \(x_2 = x_1\). So
\((x_2, y_2) \textbf{F} (x_1, y_1)\).

{\bf F is transitive:} Assume \((x_1, y_1) \textbf{F} (x_2, y_2)\) and \((x_2, y_2) \textbf{F} (x_3, y_3)\). Then
\(x_1 = x_2\) and \(x_2 = x_3\). Thus \(x_1 = x_3\) and so \((x_1, y_1) \textbf{F} (x_3, y_3)\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 29}
Let \(A = \R \times \R\). A relation {\bf S} is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)
\) in \(A, (x_1, y_1) \textbf{S} (x_2, y_2) \iff y_1 = y_2\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf S is reflexive:}

{\bf S is symmetric:}

{\bf S is transitive:}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 30}
Let \(A\) be the “punctured plane”; that is, \(A\) is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane except the origin 
(0, 0). A relation \(R\) is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) in \(A, p_1 \, R \, p_2 \iff 
p_1\) and \(p_2\) lie on the same half line emanating from the origin.

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} For all \(p \in A, p\) and \(p\) lie on the same half line emanating from the origin.
So \(p \, R \, p\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(p_1 \, R \, p_2\). Then \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) lie on the same half line 
emanating from the origin. Then \(p_2\) and \(p_1\) lie on the same half line emanating from the origin. So
\(p_2 \, R \, p_1\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is transitive:} First notice that for any \(p \in A\) there is exactly one half line emanating from 
the origin on which $p$ lies.

Assume \(p_1 \, R \, p_2\) and \(p_2 \, R \, p_3\). Then \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) lie on the same half line emanating from 
the origin, say $l_1$. And \(p_2\) and \(p_3\) lie on the same half line emanating from the origin, say $l_2$. Since 
$p_2$ lies on both $l_1$ and $l_2$, by the previous paragraph \(l_1 = l_2\). Then \(p_1\) and \(p_3\) lie on 
the same half line emanating from the origin. So \(p_1 \, R \, p_3\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 31}
Let \(A\) be the set of people living in the world today. A relation \(R\) is defined on \(A\) as follows: For all 
people \(p\) and \(q\) in \(A, p \, R \, q \iff p\) lives within 100 miles of \(q\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} For every person $p$, $p$ lives within 0 miles of $p$, so in particular $p$ lives 
within 100 miles of $p$. Therefore \(p \, R \, p\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(p \, R \, q\). So $p$ lives within 100 miles of $q$. Then $q$ lives within 
100 miles of $p$. Thus \(q \, R \, p\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is not transitive:} As a counterexample, take $p$ to be an inhabitant of Chicago, Illinois, $q$ an 
inhabitant of Kankakee, Illinois, and $r$ an inhabitant of Champaign, Illinois. Then \(p \,R\, q\) because Chicago is 
less than 100 miles from Kankakee, and \(q \,R\, r\) because Kankakee is less than 100 miles from Champaign, but 
\(p \, \Ccancel{R}\, r\) because Chicago is not less than 100 miles from Champaign.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 32}
Let \(A\) be the set of all lines in the plane. A relation \(R\) is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \(l_1\) and 
\(l_2\) in \(A, l_1 \, R \, l_2 \iff l_1\) is parallel to \(l_2\). (Assume that a line is parallel to itself.)

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is reflexive:} For every line \(l \in A, l\) is parallel to itself, therefore \(l \, R \, l\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(l_1 \, R \, l_2\). Then \(l_1\) is parallel to \(l_2\). Then \(l_2\) is 
parallel to \(l_1\), so \(l_2 \, R \, l_1\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is transitive:} Assume \(l_1 \, R \, l_2\) and \(l_2 \, R \, l_3\). Then \(l_1\) is parallel to $l_2$
and \(l_2\) is parallel to $l_3$. By transitivity of parallelism \(l_1\) is parallel to \(l_3\) so \(l_1 \, R \, l_3\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 33}
Let \(A\) be the set of all lines in the plane. A relation \(R\) is defined on \(A\) as follows: For every \(l_1\) and 
\(l_2\) in \(A, l_1 \, R \, l_2 \iff l_1\) is perpendicular to \(l_2\).

\begin{proof}
{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is not reflexive:} For evert line $l$ in $A$, $l$ is not perpendicular to itself ($l$ is parallel to
itself). Therefore \(l \,\Ccancel{R}\, l\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is symmetric:} Assume \(l_1 \, R \, l_2\). Then \(l_1\) is perpendicular to \(l_2\). Then \(l_2\) is 
perpendicular to \(l_1\). So \(l_2 \, R \, l_1\).

{\bf \(\bm{R}\) is not transitive:} Let $l_1$ be the line $y = 0$, let $l_2$ be the line $x = 0$ and $l_3$ be the 
line $y = 1$. Then $l_2$ is perpendicular to both $l_1$ and $l_3$ so \(l_1 \, R \, l_2\) and \(l_2 \, R \, l_3\). But
$l_1$ is parallel to $l_3$ so \(l_1 \, \Ccancel{R} \,l_3\).
\end{proof}

{\bf \cy In $34-36$, assume that $R$ is a relation on a set $A$. Prove or disprove each statement.}

\subsection{Exercise 34}
If \(R\) is reflexive, then \(R^{-1}\) is reflexive.

\begin{proof}
Suppose $R$ is any reflexive relation on a set $A$. {\it [We must show that \(R^{-1}\) is reflexive. To show this, 
we must show that for every \(x\) in \(A, x \, R^{-1} x\).]} Given any element \(x\) in \(A\), since \(R\) is 
reflexive, \(x \,R\, x\), and by definition of relation, this means that \((x, x) \in R\). It follows, by definition 
of the inverse of a relation, that \((x, x) \in R^{-1}\), and so, by definition of relation, \(x \,R^{-1}\, x\) {\it 
[as was to be shown].}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 35}
If \(R\) is symmetric, then \(R^{-1}\) is symmetric.

\begin{proof}
Assume \(R\) is symmetric. {\it [We want to show \(R^{-1}\) is symmetric.]} Assume \(x \, R^{-1} \, y\). We need to 
show \(y \, R^{-1} \, x\). By definition of \(R^{-1}, y \, R \, x\). Since \(R\) is symmetric, \(x \, R \, y\). By
definition of \(R^{-1}\) again, \(y \, R^{-1} \, x\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 36}
If \(R\) is transitive, then \(R^{-1}\) is transitive.

\begin{proof}
Assume \(R\) is transitive. {\it [We want to show \(R^{-1}\) is transitive.]} Assume \(x \, R^{-1} \, y\) and \(y \, 
R^{-1} \, z\). We need to show \(x \, R^{-1} \, z\). By definition of \(R^{-1}, y \, R \, x\) and \(z \, R \, y\). 
Since \(R\) is transitive, \(z \, R \, x\). By definition of \(R^{-1}\) again, \(x \, R^{-1} \, z\).
\end{proof}

{\bf \cy In $37-42$, assume that \(R\) and \(S\) are relations on a set \(A\). Prove or disprove each 
statement.}

\subsection{Exercise 37}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are reflexive, is \(R \cap S\) reflexive? Why?

\begin{proof}
Yes. Suppose $R$ and $S$ are reflexive. {\it [To show that \(R \cap S\) is reflexive, we must show that \(\forall x 
\in A, (x, x) \in R \cap S\).]} So suppose \(x \in A\). Since $R$ is reflexive, \((x, x) \in R\), and since $S$ is 
reflexive, \((x, x) \in S\). Thus, by definition of intersection, \((x, x) \in R \cap S\) {\it [as was to be shown].}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 38}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are symmetric, is \(R \cap S\) symmetric? Why?

\begin{proof}
Yes. Suppose $R$ and $S$ are symmetric. {\it [To show that \(R \cap S\) is symmetric, we must show that \(\forall x,y 
\in A\), if \((x, y) \in R \cap S\) then \((y, x) \in R \cap S\).]} So suppose \(x,y \in A\) and \((x, y) \in R 
\cap S\). By definition of intersection \((x, y) \in R\) and \((x,y)\in S\). Since $R$ is symmetric, \((y,x)\in R\), 
and since $S$ is symmetric, \((y, x) \in S\). Thus, by definition of intersection, \((y, x) \in R \cap S\) 
{\it [as was to be shown].}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 39}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are transitive, is \(R \cap S\) transitive? Why?

\begin{proof}
Yes. Suppose $R$ and $S$ are transitive. {\it [To show that \(R \cap S\) is transitive, we must show that \(\forall x,y 
,z \in A\), if \((x, y) \in R \cap S\) and \((y, z) \in R \cap S\) then \((x, z) \in R \cap S\).]} So suppose \(x,y,z 
\in A\) and \((x, y) \in R \cap S\) and \((y, z) \in R \cap S\). By definition of intersection \((x, y) \in R\) and 
\((x,y)\in S\) and \((y, z) \in R\) and \((y,z)\in S\). Since $R$ is transitive, \((x,z)\in R\), and since $S$ is 
transitive, \((x, z) \in S\). Thus, by definition of intersection, \((x, z) \in R \cap S\) {\it [as was to be shown].}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 40}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are reflexive, is \(R \cup S\) reflexive? Why?

\begin{proof}
Yes. To prove this we must show that for all $x$ in $A$, \((x, x) \in R \cup S\). So suppose \(x\) is a particular 
but arbitrarily chosen element in \(A\). {\it [We must show that \((x, x) \in R \cup S\).]} Then \((x, x) \in R\) 
because $R$ is reflexive, and hence \((x, x) \in R \cup S\) by definition of union, {\it [as was to be shown]}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 41}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are symmetric, is \(R \cup S\) symmetric? Why?

\begin{proof}
Yes. To prove this we must show that for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$, if \((x, y) \in R \cup S\) then \((y, x) \in R \cup 
S\). So suppose \((x, y)\) is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element in \(R \cup S\). {\it [We must show that 
\((y, x) \in R \cup S\).]} By definition of union, \((x, y) \in R\) or \((x, y) \in S\). In case \((x, y) \in R\), then 
\((y, x) \in R\) because $R$ is symmetric, and hence \((y, x) \in R \cup S\) by definition of union. In case \((x, y) 
\in S\) then \((y, x) \in S\) because $S$ is symmetric, and hence \((y, x) \in R \cup S\) by definition of union. Thus, 
in both cases, \((y, x) \in R \cup S\) {\it [as was to be shown]}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 42}
If \(R\) and \(S\) are transitive, is \(R \cup S\) transitive? Why?

\begin{proof}
No. Let \(A = \{a,b,c,d\}, R = \{(a,b),(b,c),(a,c)\}, S = \{(c,a),(a,d),(c,d)\}\). Then $R$ and $S$ are transitive but
\(R \cup S\) is not: \((a,c) \in R \cup S\) and \((c,a) \in R \cup S\) but \((a,a) \notin R \cup S\).
\end{proof}

{\bf \cy In \(43-50\), the following definitions are used: a relation on a set \(A\) is defined to be irreflexive if, 
and only if, for every \(x \in A, x \, \Ccancel[cyan]{R} \, x\); asymmetric if, and only if, for every \(x, y \in A\) 
if \(x \, R \, y\) then \(y \Ccancel[cyan]{R} x\); intransitive if, and only if, for every \(x, y, z \in A\), 
if \(x R y\) and \(y R z\) then \(x \Ccancel[cyan]{R} z\). For each of the relations in the referenced exercise, 
determine whether the relation is irreflexive, asymmetric, intransitive, or none of these.}

\subsection{Exercise 43}
Exercise 1
\begin{proof}
\(R_1\) is not irreflexive because \((0, 0) \in R_1\). \(R_1\) is not asymmetric because \((0, 1) \in R_1\) and 
\((1, 0) \in R_1\). \(R_1\) is not intransitive because \((0, 1) \in R_1\) and \((1, 0) \in R_1\) and \((0, 0) \in R_1\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 44}
Exercise 2
\begin{proof}
Recall \(R_2 = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3)\}\).

\(R_2\) is not irreflexive because \((0, 0) \in R_2\).

\(R_2\) is not asymmetric because \((0, 0) \in R_2\) and \((0, 0) \in R_2\).

\(R_2\) is not intransitive because \((0, 0) \in R_2\) and \((0,1) \in R_2\) and \((0,1) \in R_2\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 45}
Exercise 3
\begin{proof}
$R_3$ is irreflexive because no element of $A$ is related by $R_3$ to itself. $R_3$ is not asymmetric because 
\((2, 3) \in R_3\) and \((3, 2) \in R_3\). $R_3$ is intransitive. To see why, observe that $R_3$ consists only 
of \((2, 3)\) and \((3, 2)\). Now \((2, 3) \in R_3\) and \((3, 2) \in R_3\) but \((2, 2) \notin R_3\). Also 
\((3, 2) \in R_3\) and \((2, 3) \in R_3\) but \((3, 3) \notin R_3\).
\end{proof}

Recall \(R_5 = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)\}\).

\(R_5\) is not irreflexive because \((0,0) \in R_5\).

\(R_5\) is not asymmetric because \((0, 0) \in R_5\) and \((0, 0) \in R_5\).

\(R_5\) is not intransitive because \((0,1) \in R_5\) and \((1,2) \in R_5\) and \((0,2) \in R_5\).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Exercise 48}
Exercise 6
\begin{proof}
Recall \(R_6 = \{(0, 1), (0, 2)\}\). \(R_6\) is irreflexive because no element of \(A\) is related by \(R_6\) to 
itself. \(R_6\) is asymmetric because \(R_6\) consists only of \((0, 1)\) and \((0, 2)\) and neither \((1, 0)\) nor 
\((2, 0)\) is in \(R_6\). \(R_6\) is not intransitive. Let \(x = y = z = 0\). Then \((x, y) \in R_6\) and 
\((y, z) \in R_6\) and \((x, z) \in R_6\).
\end{proof}

asymmetric because \((0,0) \in R_8\) and \((0,0) \in R_8\).
\(R_8\) is intransitive.
